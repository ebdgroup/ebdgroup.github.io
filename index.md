## Communication

We will use slack for anouncements, discussion forums, and even virtual office hours. Please use this [link](https://join.slack.com/t/eece2160-fall17-s8/shared_invite/MjM0ODI5ODIyNTMwLTE1MDQyMjY4NDMtMGE5MTRmM2I3OQ) to join the group.

Homeworks will be distributed using Github Classroom. I will create a link for each assigmen. Please register an account on [Github](https://github.com) if you do not have one.

Some of the assignment will require access to a Linux system. You can install a Linux system on your personal computer. If you are using Windows 10, Bash on Windows is also a choice. Otherwise, COE provides servers for remote access. Y ou will need an account on the COE linux machines (gateway.coe.neu.edu). Most of you have the COE accounts already from your previous classes. You will need your COE username and password to access them. If you have forgotten your password, please stop by the COE help desk at 273, 275, or 277 Snell Engineering Building. If you do not have a COE account, you can request one here.

## Overview

This course presents fundamental concepts of Computer Engineering from a comprehensive, full-stack, software-hardware design perspective. The course explores scripting languages, high-level programming, Unix/Linux operating systems, device drivers, software-hardware interfaces, hardware controllers, and digital circuit design. The course is accompanied by a hands-on lab where students apply theoretical concepts on a full-system ZedBoard platform, featuring a programmable logic module, an ARM processor, and an Ubuntu distribution of the Linux operating system. Students will design custom creative software-hybrid designs interacting with a variety of hardware devices connected to the ZedBoard, including LEDs, push buttons, switches, OLED screens, a Wiimote, and a remote-controlled robotic arm.
